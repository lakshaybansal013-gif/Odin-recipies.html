       <br> <h3>Description</h3>
       <br> <p>Lasagna (or lasagne) is an iconic Italian baked pasta dish consisting of stacked layers of flat pasta sheets, alternating with fillings such as ragù (meat and tomato sauce), cheese, and seasonings. It is believed to have originated in Italy during the Middle Ages, with roots in ancient Greece, and has evolved into various regional specialties, most notably lasagne alla bolognese, which typically uses béchamel sauce instead of ricotta</p>
       <br> <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Pasta:</strong> Wide, flat sheets, either fresh or dried (sometimes with ruffled edges called <em>lasagna riccia</em> ).</li>
        <li><strong>Meat Sauce (Ragù):</strong>A slow-cooked mix of ground meat (beef, pork, or Italian sausage), aromatics (onion, carrot, celery), tomatoes, and wine.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese Sauce/Filling:</strong>Traditionally, this is a creamy <strong>béchamel sauce</strong> (white sauce) in Northern Italy. In Italian-American versions, this is substituted with a mixture of ricotta cheese, parmesan, and eggs.</li>
        <li><strong>Topping:</strong>Shredded mozzarella and parmesan are used for a golden, bubbly top layer.</li>
       </ul>
       <br><h3>Steps</h3>
       <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Sauce:</strong>In a large pot, brown the ground beef and sausage with onion and garlic over medium-high heat. Drain excess grease. Add tomato paste, marinara sauce, and Italian seasoning. Simmer for 15-30 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Cheese Filling: </strong>In a bowl, mix the ricotta cheese, egg, Parmesan, and seasonings.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble:</strong>Spread 1 cup of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch pan. Add a layer of noodles. Spread 1/3 of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by 1.5 cups of meat sauce and a layer of mozzarella. Repeat twice. Top with remaining sauce and cheese.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong>Cover with foil (sprayed with cooking spray to prevent sticking) and bake at 375°F for 30 minutes. Remove foil and bake for another 15-20 minutes until bubbly</li>
        <li><strong>Rest:</strong>Allow the lasagna to sit for at least 15-30 minutes before cutting to ensure the layers set properly.</li>
       </ol>
